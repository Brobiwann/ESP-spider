# ESP-spider

The ESP-Spider is a quadruped robot inspired by the miniKame (https://github.com/JavierIH/miniKame) . Like the miniKame, it uses sinusoidal functions to control servo positions,
but the design and code were developed independently to better learn the process.
Currently, the robot performs three main actions: move forward, turn right, and turn left, with plans to add more functions in the future as I learn.

# Electronics

The robot features a custom PCB (gerber files and KiCad project are in the repository) with:

  - ESP32 module
  - PCA9685 for PWM control of servos
    
Additional components:

  - 8x MG92B servos
  - 3x 18650 cells
  - 3S BMS 40A 12V with balance charging
  - DFR0753 (DC-DC Buck Converter 6â€“14V to 5V/8A)
  - Adafruit 1.2" 8x8 LED Matrix Backpack
  - 2.1mmx5.5mm DC Power Jack (Female)
  - Mini 5V fan (20mmx10mm)

# 3D Printing

All STL, Soliworks and STEP files are provided in the repository.
The design is optimized for resin printing and also uses 4x 11mm ball bearings to support the robot weight.
The assembly is completed using M3 and M2 bolts and nuts
